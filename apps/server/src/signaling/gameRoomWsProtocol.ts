/**
 * Generic game-room signaling message type constants (server side).
 *
 * Parallel to {@link ./mafiaWsProtocol.ts MafiaWs} but for the
 * `gameroom:<base>` room-id namespace. Mirrors only the GENERIC subset of
 * the Mafia protocol — explicitly OMITS Mafia-specific surfaces:
 *
 *   - `mafia:mode-update`       (old/new mode is a Mafia game variant)
 *   - `mafia:settings-update`   (dead-background gallery is Mafia UI theming)
 *   - `mafia:page-background-settings` (page-background gallery is Mafia UI)
 *   - role assignment inside `mafia:reshuffle`
 *   - `mafia:players-update.nightActions / clearRoles / oldMafiaMode`
 *
 * The client maintains a matching copy at
 * `apps/client/src/composables/gameRoomWsProtocol.ts` (added in Phase 3B).
 * The two copies must stay in sync; the separate constants avoid an unwanted
 * server↔client import boundary crossing (same per-side pattern Mafia /
 * Nadle / Checkers already use).
 *
 * Do NOT delete or rename any literal. Each value is a wire-format identity
 * that the client is also pinned to.
